<h2 align='center'> About the Project</h2>

<h3 align='center'>Background and Motivation</h3>

For many, practicing for interviews can be tough without somebody to give feedback. JobPrepr is an online tool which empowers users to practice for (non-technical) interviews by allowing them to record responses to questions randomly selected from a pool, and receive feedback on their facial expressions and sentiment of their speech.

Built in a 2 week sprint as part of Le Wagon's Data Science Bootcamp, in collaboration with:

- Andrei Danila - https://github.com/AndreiCDanila
- Martin Skalicky - https://github.com/skoooty
- Milica Šćepanović - https://github.com/scepanovicka

<h3 align='center'>Technologies and Frameworks Used - Frontend</h3>

The frontend for the project used a number of technologies and frameworks, including:

- Streamlit with WebRTC and custom CSS

- OpenCV

- Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for user login and result storing

- SQL Alchemy

  

  in addition to the technologies used by the backend (linked at the top of this readme).

At this time, these services are disabled due to run costs. If you would like a demonstration, feel free to contact me, or feel free to clone this repository and deploy to your own GCP database to enable full functionality.

Otherwise, take a look at our live demonstration of the our app using the link below (timestamp: 1:08:05)!
